# what is it
it is a simple python program to help you get followers. it favorites tweets under a certain keyword. it then follows those who have followed you. it works.

# please be gentle
this code is very horrible, uses bad programming practices and some dodgy error handling.

# current features
* retweet x amount of tweets
* find tweets by keyword
* follow the followers
* rate limit handling
* error handling
